## **Planning Stage**

### **Target Audience**
* Created 3 target personas, to see if the website is suitable for all needs

* Charlotte is after a quick quote for her parents, which is available from the website, as there is a possibility to send a quick message straight away as an inquiry, or get on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, since she is present on all social media platforms. She is also using the website from her phone, which is possible, since the media queries are in place and working. 

* John is a professional, who has his own ideas about his new kitchen. He can find the website easily with the tight keywords in Google and make his dream kitchen come true in one click in the enquiry section.

* Linda is a homeowner, retired, enjoying her life, but not very comfortable with using her PC or the internet. She needs the website to be very user friendly, also easy to search and look through. She also needs an easy enquiry option, as she prefers picking up the phone, so the Contact Us section needs to be visible straight on the top. 


### **Wireframes**
To help organise how I was going to approach building the site I first got my initial ideas down onto some wireframe to help guide me through the basic layout of the site as I implemented various features. 
Links to the different pages:
* [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/home-about.png)
* [Club Sessions page](docs/wireframes/club-sessions.png)
* [Join Us page](docs/wireframes/join-us.png)

There was some deviation from the initial design as I implemented each page to improve the user experience but in general I stayed true to the initial design.

### **Color Scheme**
I chose a color scheme that was in keeping with the Flukey Feathers color scheme (#990000) whilst also being  easy to read for the user, through the use of back ground images and the navigation / footer color schemes, opting for a smokey white background (#f5f5f5) and dark grey text (#2d302e) in areas where these weren't used. I used (https://userway.org/) to check the contrasting colors worked well.
