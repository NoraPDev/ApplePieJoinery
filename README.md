## **Planning Stage**

### **Target Audience**
* Created 3 target personas, to see if the website is suitable for all needs

* Charlotte is a young university student with a tech knowledge. She is after a quick quote for her parents, which is available from the website, as there is a possibility to send a quick message straight away as an inquiry, or get on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, since she is present on all social media platforms. She is also using the website from her phone, which is possible, since the media queries are in place and working. 

* John is a professional, who has his own ideas about his new kitchen. He can find the website easily with the tight keywords in Google and make his dream kitchen come true in one click in the enquiry section.

* Linda is a homeowner, retired, enjoying her life, but not very comfortable with using her PC or the internet. She needs the website to be very user friendly, also easy to search and look through. She also needs an easy enquiry option, as she prefers picking up the phone, so the Contact Us section needs to be visible straight on the top. 


### **Wireframe**
The initial idea of the website was created in Balsamiq, to help me guide through the building stage as the different features have been added. 
As the website became more and more visually attractive, it was clear that some features were missing, therefore I had to make some additional implementations, for it to be user friendly and better from a sales perspectives.

### **Colour Scheme**
Initially I chose the colors to be true to the main welcome picture using only my own eyes as a judge, however later on I used the below colour scheme to help with the right contrasts and shades. 
In my opinion this color being a pastel colour scheme is not too aggressive for a user, therefore it is comfortable on the eyes. 
I wanted the website to be easily readable and color blind friendly as well.
